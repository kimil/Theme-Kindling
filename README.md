Statamic Kindling Base Theme
================================

## Installing
1. Download the zip file (or clone via git) and unzip it or clone the repo into `/themes/`.
2. Name the folder whatever you want.
3. Rename the `/css/kindling.css` and `/js/kindling.js` files to match the theme name.

## Purpose

This theme is intended to be a base starting point for building your custom Statamic site or theme. There is *literally* no style or layout markup of any kind within.

## Theme Approach

Kindling has *more* going on than necessary. Remove anythning you don't plan to use. It's easier to remove than to add. Coffeescript, Compass, Sass, just blow em away if you want. We don't mind.
